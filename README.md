# FPGA training modules

A collection of Verilog modules that adds a number of useful indicators on screen, similar to leds, switches and displays that most FPGA trainers have.
These modules are aimed to FPGA boards featuring at least a VGA output and a PS/2 connector for keyboard input. Project files are currently targeting these boards:
- UnAmiga. http://unamiga.forofpga.es
- ZXDOS.   http://zxdos.forofpga.es
- ZX-UNO original version. http://www.zxuno.com
- ZX-UNO RGB 18-bit enhanced output. http://www.zxuno.com

Along the modules, there is a number of Verilog examples to show some features of them, and serve as templates for your own projects.
